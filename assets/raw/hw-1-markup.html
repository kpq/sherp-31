• try not to use html tags that dictate presentation. no brs, no center tags, no rule tags, etc. css can do all of those things.

• try not to make web pages that dont look like other web pages you see on the pages of a news org (so no colored backgrounds, headlines in front of images, etc.)

• tables are hard to style, but a little knowledge goes a long way and can make your tables look much more professional. in general,

even these can go a long way:

table {
  border-collapse:collapse;
}
table td {
  padding:10px 0;
  border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;
}

• add a byline!

• make sure your CSS is valid. if it's not (missing semicolons, too many brackets, no closing tags, etc.), all sorts of things aren't going to work. you can paste your CSS here: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input and it will tell you if you screwed anythign up.

• in general, body copy should be black. sometimes we cheat and make it dark grey, like #333 or even #666 for background text, but black should be your default.

• good fonts to stick to are arial, georgia, maybe verdana. courier not so much.

• in general, dont use icons or clip art as a substiture for traditional charting tools. unless you're really, really clever.

• have a page title. it helps google find your page for others. it's a good practice.
