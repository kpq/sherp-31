"Fork" in this context means "Make a copy of their code so that I can add my own modifications". There's not much else to say.



First, I made a new folder in my local directory that has my github site. For me, that's kpq.github.io. For you, it's username.github.io). I called that folder "map-homework."

Then I went to the stately web site [http://intridea.github.io/stately/] and read where it says "Basic Use Case." It says: "Download and add the Stately folder to your project which includes the base CSS and the web font files. and add the stately.css to the head of your document." I followed the download link to the Stately github page. [https://github.com/intridea/stately] It looks a lot like our github pages.

Instead of getting the files with git clone, I downloaded a ZIP file of the package. Then I opened the and unzipped the files. I opened the folder called "stateley-master" and put all of its contents into my folder called "map homework." To see if it worked, I opened the page "stately.html" in a web browser. The demo appeared to work.

I then renamed "stately.html" to "class-2.html" and edited the file exactly how we did in class. I did do some mild CSS changes, like making the map 600px wide and changing the styles a little, and I added a key from the same place we did in lab.

I then added, commited and pushed, just like we did in class. It worked, and after a short time I had a file at kpq.github.io/homework-help/class-2.html
