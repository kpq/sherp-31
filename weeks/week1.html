    <p4 class="nyu-2013-dj-lab-intro-graf">Before we do anything super useful or innovative with our soon-to-be-shiny data skills, we need to be able to have a place to write our files so they are public on the internet. This exercise will make sure everyone is properly set up to publish files on Github pages.</p>

<!--     <ol class="nyu-2013-dj-lab-instructions">

      <li>First, we'll make a basic html file. Open a text editor of choice (Textmate, TextWrangler, NoteBook++, whatever) and begin a new, empty file. Call it <code>index.html</code>.</li>
      <li>Type <code>Hello, world!</code> in the file and save it.</li>
      <li>Now open the file in a web browser like Chrome, Safari or Firefox. What do you see?</li>
      <li>Now let's make our file a little more useful. Delete your <code>hello world</code> and instead type <code>&lt;h1&gt;Your name here&lt;/h1&gt;</code>.</li>
      <li>Hit enter a couple times and start on a new line. Let's make a subhed for the page. Call it <code>Homework assignments for data journalism</code>. Use an <code>h2</code> tag, since it's a headline, but not the most important headline on the page.</li>

      <li>Now we'll make a table, which is one of the trickier elements to code up in html. This will be a simple table of your homework assignments, which you'll update every week for class so they are easy for you, your classmates and your teachers to return to. First, it helps to have a goal. So let's say once it's totally done, we'd like the first four rows of our table to look something like this: <img src="../assets/images/generic-hw-table.png"></li>

      <li>Here's <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">a helper for table markup</a>. Feel free to follow the instructions below or just cut and paste from the W3Schools site.</li>
      <li>Start by making the closing and ending tags for a table. <code>&lt;table&gt; ... &lt;/table&gt;</code>. Make some space between them to you have room to write more.</li>
      <li>In HTML tables, every row is its own <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>element and the columns inside that row are called <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> elements, for "table-data." So make a <code>&lt;tr&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;</code> tag with some blank space between them. This is good for one table row!</li>
      <li>Next we'll make the column headers for this table. Normally, these would just be <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> elements, but because they are the "headers" for the table, they get a special <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>tag. So make the three headers for your table (inside your <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tag) :
        <code class='nyu-code-block'>&lt;th&gt;Week&lt;/th&gt;</code>
        <code class='nyu-code-block'>&lt;th&gt;Due date&lt;/th&gt;</code>
        <code class='nyu-code-block'>&lt;th&gt;Link&lt;/th&gt;</code>
        Tip! Make sure you indent your code correctly so it's easy to read.
      </li>

      <li>Let's make another row, just like the first one, but instead of adding &lt;th&gt; tags, make them <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tags, since they aren't table headers anymore. Open your file in a browser. What does it look like? If it looks right (even though it's unstyled), check with your neighbor to make sure he or she is on the same page.</li>

      <li>Make the other three rows so your table looks like the example, at least as far as content is concerned.</li>

      <li>Once your page is done and has been checked by Kevin or Amanda, put it on your web site (if you know how) and post the link to this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QNNza91ECKWI2M-89bRhPUPj1gXC_IMZcG95jV6FOTE/edit">public Google doc</a>. <strong>If you don't know how, see "Steps to publishing your file on your public NYU page" at the bottom of this page.</strong> If enough people haven't done it, we can do it together, too.</li>

    <h5 class="nyu-2013-lab-lab-sub-subhed">Steps to publishing your file on your public NYU page.</h5>

    <ol class="nyu-2013-dj-lab-instructions">

      <li>As NYU students, you should all have an id of some sort. Kevin's is kq2; Amanda's is arc320. Whatever it is, go to <a href="http://home.nyu.edu">http://home.nyu.edu</a> and enter your id and password. Once you're there, select "files" from the nav menu.</li>
      <li>Once you're there, select "Activate public folder," which will put a folder called "public" in your directory and allow anything inside it to be public. Once you do that, select the button that says "Files 2.0 login."</li>
      <li>You should now be on a page that shows the structure of a series of files at your onlineID. Double click the "public" folder. Then hit the "Upload" icon on the top-roght of the page. Select your homework index page and upload it. </li>
      <li>Open up a new browser and see if it worked. You should be able to access your files at files.nyu.edu/yourOnlineID/public/yourFileName.html. Did it? If it did, prove it to your neighbors.</li>

    <ul class="nyu-2013-dj-lab-instructions questions">
      <li>Say you were not making one page but a complex web site with this method? What, if any, problems would you come across?</li>
      <li>Was there anything about this process that you found surprisingly easy or difficult?</li>
      <li>If you have your own domain and hosting through a third-party, how does the publishing process compare?</li>

    <h5 class="nyu-2013-lab-lab-sub-subhed">Steps to publishing your file on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>.</h5>

    <p class="nyu-2013-dj-lab-intro-graf">As we hope you will realize, it's extremely annoying using a site like NYU's to maintain a real web site. So let's take advantage of the free sites available on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> to behave like adults.</p>


      <ol class="nyu-2013-dj-lab-instructions">

        <li>You'll need to have git installed on your machine. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages">Here's a helper</a>, though we'll spend some time in class doing this as well.</li>

        <li>The first step is to create an account with GitHub. Create a username and password. Once you log in, click on "Create a repository."</li>

        <li>You want to create a <strong>user page</strong> with Github pages, which will let you publish files to the web for free. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages">Here's some documentation</a> if you stray from the instructions below.</li>

        <li>The name of your repository <strong>must be</strong> <code>username/username.github.io</code>. Here's what Amanda's looked like:

        <img src="../assets/images/amanvin-gh-pages.png">
        </li>

        <li>Make sure you check "Initialize this repository with a README" as well. Then click the button that says "Create repository."</li>

        <li>You've just intialized a git repository! Nice. Now we should start adding to it.</li>

        <li>Somewhere on your computer, make a folder called <code>data-journalism</code> and navigate to it in the Terminal. (Ask your neighbor if you have trouble.)</li>

        <li>Copy the clone address, shown below, to your clipboard.
            <img src="../assets/images/git-clone.png" width="800">
        </li>

        <li>In the terminal, type <code>git clone</code> followed by the url you copied. So, in Amanda's case, she would tyoe <code>git clone https://github.com/amandacox/amandacox.github.io.git</code> and then hit enter. If it worked, you should get some messages saying things like this:

        <img src = "../assets/images/success.png" style="margin-top:20px;">

        </li>

        <li>Navigate to the folder you just cloned using the terminal.</li>

        <li>Using either the terminal or your Finder window, move the <code>index.html</code> file you created above (the table with homework dates on it) to your project folder.</li>

        <li>Now you're ready to check in some code. (Sweet!) From the terminal, type the following: <br>

          <code> git add .</code><br>
          <code> git commit -m "initial commit for class"</code> <br>
          <code> git push </code> <br>
        </li>

        <li>It should take about 10 minutes for that to show up. But when it does, you will find it at [yourusername].github.io. If you think you did it right, show your instructors, then help a friend.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4 class="nyu-2013-dj-week-header">Homework</h4>
    <p class="nyu-2013-week-intro-graf">Your assignment for Monday is simple. First, enter the url for your public GitHub site (gitHubUsername.github.io) on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QNNza91ECKWI2M-89bRhPUPj1gXC_IMZcG95jV6FOTE/edit">public Google doc</a>.</p>

    <p>Second, edit your index.html page to include your name, and email address and push it to git using the terminal. A sample file is <a href="../assets/raw/sample-index-page.html">here</a>, or you can do it by hand if you prefer. </p>
