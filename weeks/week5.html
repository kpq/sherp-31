    <h4 class="nyu-2013-dj-week-header">Lab: Chrome inspector</h4>

    <p class="nyu-2013-dj-lab-intro-graf">The inspector in chrome is an extremely useful tool for all sorts of functions. Today we'll use it for help in three things: styling pages, finding "hidden" data and, if there's time, thinking about Javascript, jQuery and interactivity. </p>


     <h4 class="nyu-2013-dj-week-header">Chrome inspector: CSS</h4>

    <p class="nyu-2013-dj-lab-intro-graf">Let's get a little practice in HTML before we start messing with it in the inspector. </p>

     <ol class="nyu-2013-dj-lab-instructions">
      <li>Download this <a href="../assets/raw/loose-markup.html">unformatted HTML file</a> (taken from an example exercise from the wonderful <a href="http://codewithme.us/">Code With Me</a>into a folder.</li>

      <li>Open it as a text editor and let's mark it up together.</li>

      <li>Save your new version as <code>article.html</code>.</li>

      <li>Now we'll split up into two groups. Group 1, which will be called team Amanvin, will try to make their page look like it belongs on the Onion. Group 2, team Kemanda, will make the article look like it's an article on the New York Times. We'll do some stuff together before you get the hang of it. After about 30 minutes, we'll see which team is in better shape. You will need to google a lot, most likely, but <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp">this, from w3schools </a> is a pretty useful reference.</li>

     </ol>


  <h4 class="nyu-2013-dj-week-header">Merging with vlookup</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Let's practice vlookup with this data on <a href="../assets/data/drunkdrivingdeaths.xls">drunk driving deaths</a>, <a href="../assets/data/statepopulation.xls">state population</a> and <a href="../assets/data/nytnames.xls">state abbreviations</a>.</li>
  </ol>




  <h4 class="nyu-2013-dj-week-header">Asking questions, getting answers</h4>

  <ol class="nyu-2013-dj-lab-instructions">
    <li>Here is some data about how many bikes <a href="../assets/data/bikes.csv">data</a> are at CitiBike Stations.</li>
    <li>Spend 10 minutes writing down some questions you might ask this data in <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bliOQvBKQcea_EniWYy9i5lVu3wI_t6Jy3JvY2VCng8/edit">this Google Doc.</a></li>
    <li>Together, let's pick out the best questions and answer them, making sure we practice pivot tables and learn about vlookup. Here are <a href = "../assets/data/bike-neighborhoods.csv"> the neighborhoods</a> each station belongs to.</li>
